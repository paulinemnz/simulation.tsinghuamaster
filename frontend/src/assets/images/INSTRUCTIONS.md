# Image Assets Instructions

## Current Status
✅ SVG versions of both images have been created and are ready to use.

## Files Created:
1. **sem-logo.svg** - SEM logo (purple circular emblem with star and Chinese characters)
2. **robot-image.svg** - Futuristic robot image (thinking pose)

## If You Have Original Image Files:

If you have the original PNG/JPG versions of these images and want to use them instead:

1. **Replace the SVG files** with your image files:
   - Save your SEM logo as: `sem-logo.png` (or `.jpg`)
   - Save your robot image as: `robot-image.png` (or `.jpg`)

2. **Update the imports** in `LandingPage.tsx`:
   - Change `sem-logo.svg` to `sem-logo.png` (or your file extension)
   - Change `robot-image.svg` to `robot-image.png` (or your file extension)

3. **Recommended image specifications:**
   - **SEM Logo**: Square format, 200x200px or higher resolution
   - **Robot Image**: Portrait format, 600x800px or higher resolution

## Current Setup
The SVG versions are already working and will display on the landing page. They are vector-based and will scale perfectly at any size.

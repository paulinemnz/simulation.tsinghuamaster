        "Body: Dear Terraform Management, I am writing to express my profound disappointment regarding how our partnership has been evaluated by your system. We have learned that PolskaStal has been flagged as a 'cost volatility risk' by your AI assessment tools. This characterization deeply offends us, as it reduces 15 years of reliable partnership, quality delivery, and mutual trust to a mere data point. We have always been transparent about market conditions affecting our pricing, including energy costs and raw material fluctuations. We have never hidden these challenges from you, and we have always worked collaboratively to find solutions that benefit both parties. To be reduced to a risk assessment without any human discussion or understanding of our circumstances is not how we expected a valued partner to treat us. Given this situation, we formally request an immediate renegotiation of our contract terms. We believe our partnership deserves a fair reassessment that takes into account not just cost metrics, but also the value of reliability, quality, and long-term relationship stability. We are open to discussing terms that reflect both our needs and yours, but we cannot continue under the current framework where we feel reduced to algorithmic inputs. We have received interest from other parties, including HexaBuild, but we would prefer to resolve this with Terraform if we can find a mutually acceptable path forward. I request an urgent meeting to discuss contract renegotiation. This relationship deserves a human conversation, not just data-driven decisions. Best regards, [PolskaStal CEO]"

        "Subject: Urgent: Contract Renegotiation Request - 15 Years of Partnership",
        "Body: Dear Terraform Leadership Team, I am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the termination notice we received via your automated system. After 15 years of partnership, during which we have consistently delivered high-quality steel components and supported your production needs, this impersonal termination feels like a betrayal of our long-standing relationship. We have always valued our partnership with Terraform and have gone above and beyond to meet your requirements, even during challenging market conditions. The fact that this decision was made by an algorithm without any prior consultation or discussion is deeply concerning. We believe that 15 years of reliable service and partnership deserves more than an automated termination notice. Therefore, we formally request an immediate renegotiation of our contract terms. We are open to discussing pricing adjustments, delivery terms, and other conditions that would allow us to continue this valuable partnership. However, I must be transparent: we have received an exclusive offer from HexaBuild that is very attractive. We would prefer to continue working with Terraform, but we need to see a commitment to our relationship that matches our commitment to you over the past 15 years. I request a meeting within the next week to discuss this matter. Our relationship deserves a human conversation, not an automated decision. Best regards, [PolskaStal CEO]"
